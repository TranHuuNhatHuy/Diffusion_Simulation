# Diffusion_Simulation
Simulations of natural diffusion and advection phenomena, based on basic partial differential equations.

This project is a final submission of the course "Partial Differential Equations in Science and Engineering", provided by TSE, Tokyo Tech. As physical quantities in science and engineering are represented by continuous values, we can formulate and solve differential equations to resemble their characteristics.

This work provides several simulations of diffusion of vapors and airborne substances, by multiple approaches, represented in their corresponding directories:
1. *Diffusion Equation*, with predefined steady-state conditions and boundary conditions (Dirichlet theory is featured in this work).
2. *Burger's Equation*, with discretization and algebraic equation in mixed boundary conditions.
3. *1-D Advection Equation*, featuring 4 approaches of analytical solution, upwind scheme, Leith's method, and CIP method.

Further details can be seen in [Final Report](https://github.com/TranHuuNhatHuy/Diffusion_Simulation/blob/master/20B60130_TranHuuNhatHuy_FinalReport.pdf).
